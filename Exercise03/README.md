This is the third exercise of the series.

It guides you through a dynamic web development approach.
We will create a website where you can insert a name and will return the reversed name.
We will have an error control to validate there is something on the form.

This approach, organizes code through different files and introduces some kind of classes.
It assumes that in web directory is only the View and in phps directory are all files involved on that View.
In classes folder is where the encapsulation of functions occurs.

You can start a php local server on PHP5.4 or upper.

php -S localhost:8000
