This is the fifth exercise of the series.

It guides you through a dynamic web development approach.
We will create a website where you can insert a name and will return the reversed name.
We will have an error control to validate there is something on the form.

This approach, we will use a framework to center our work on bussines rules.
We are going to use symfony2.
