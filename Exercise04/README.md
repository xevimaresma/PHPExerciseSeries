This is the fourth exercise of the series.

It guides you through a dynamic web development approach.
We will create a website where you can insert a name and will return the reversed name.
We will have an error control to validate there is something on the form.

This approach, organizes code through different files and is full OOP
It distributes the code througth different folders:
 - config (Application configuration)
 - src (Classes)
 - templates (html tempates)
 - tests (TDD)
 - web (static files accesible)

In src folder there ara the Core of application and a handler to handle the requests.

You can start a php local server on PHP5.4 or upper.

php -S localhost:8000
